#Chicago Crime Data Predictive Analysis
This project uses the full Chicago Crime dataset to investigate the relationship between crime and various socioeconomic factors. The project addresses four main questions:

Unemployment vs Crime (Linear Regression)
Analyzes monthly unemployment rates in relation to crime count, using linear regression and visualization to interpret the strength of correlation.

Impact of Inflation and Unemployment (Multiple Linear Regression)
Examines the combined effect of inflation and unemployment on overall crime rates. Includes a regression model, visual representation, and confusion matrix for evaluation.

Community-Based Crime Probability
Investigates whether living in specific Chicago communities influences the likelihood of being a crime victim, using statistical justification and demographic insights.

Arrest Rate Forecasting by Quarter
Compares three predictive models—Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Random Forest—to estimate quarterly arrest rates. The project concludes with a prediction of the arrest rate for January 1, 2026.
